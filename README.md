This repository contains the data for the related manuscript published in OIKOS

# Description and details of material
*.csv: *Several data tables with raw data*

*Litter decomposition data*: Separated by sites, litter species, condition (single-species or mixed species litterbags), mesh size, and organism group. Litter decomposition is given as the litter decay rate per degreedate (*k*<sub>dd</sub>)

*Macroinvertebrate abundance*: Data is given as the number of organisms per square meter

*Environmental parameters*: Please see the main manuscript for details on the units

*Metabolic capacity*: Calculated for each site follwoing the method of [Brown et al., 2004](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/03-9000)

*Invertebrate traits*: Traits were retrieved from Tachet et al., 2010

Tachet, H., Richoux, P., Bournaud, M., and Usseglio-Polatera, P. 2010. Invertébrés d’Eau Douce: Systématique, Biologie, Écologie [Freshwater Invertebrates: Systematics, Biology, Ecology]. Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

*Biodiversity effects*: Calculated for each site using the the additive partition approach by [Loreau and Hector, 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35083573)
